# Stroke-Risk-Predicition
This is Computing Maths II Group Assignment. We are doing Stroke Risk Predicition using Logistic Regression and Artificial Neural Network from scratch.

The main purpose of this project is to skow the mathematical operations behind each machine learning model, to let us get to know how mathematics plays its part in training the model. 

This project will train both models using stroke report dataset with around 15000 observations, using emsemble method to combine both models by soft voting in the final prediction of stroke.
